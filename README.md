This is a tauri application created by following the [instructions from Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js/)

I use npm, so the instructions are for npm.  If you use something else, you can figure it out for yourself.

# Getting Started with Tauri and Next.js

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Now it starts the thing and you can see the app in a window.

It provides a very basic window with a useState and useEffect hook that uses a very simple input that uses a rust function so you can see the general flow of using Next.js with Tauri and Rust.

It's my first time using Tauri, so I'm not sure if this is the best way to do things, but I don't care.  This is meant to be nothing more than basic boilerplate to get started.  I'll do more with it eventually.  Maybe.

I don't have any of the package things in the git ignore.  Best way to use this thing is to just download it as a zip and then do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  I don't know the complex git commands enough to tell you how to create a new git repo from this one.  I'm sure you can figure it out, I believe in you.  Ask an llm if you need help.
